What I've learned
-


- <strong>transform-origin : </strong> This property allows us to change the point of origin of a transform. For 2D transformation there are x- and y- axis of an element. For 3D transformation there is also z-axis. Its syntax is like that: 

`transform-origin: x-axis y-axis z-axis|initial|inherit;`

As value, It can take some keyword such as `top, left, center ....` or percentage like `100%, 50%, 0`. Actually these keywords are shorthands the percentage value.


- <strong>transition-timing-function : </strong> This are commonly called <em>easing function</em>. It used to define a function that describes how a transition will proceed over its duration and allowing a transition o change speed during its course. They can be defined using a predefined keyword value, a stepping function or a cubic BÃ©zier curve. For example:
`transition-timing-function: ease-out` 
and 
`transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1)` 
are same thing.

- I've learned working with `Date()` object.
