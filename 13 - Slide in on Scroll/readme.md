<strong>- debounce function</strong> I did a little search on the internet about the debounce function. There are generally built-in function in some library such as lodash, underscorejs. They are used not only in scroll events but also in other events such as key events. This is a perfect <a href="https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/"> article</a> about it.
